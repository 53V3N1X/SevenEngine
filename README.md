### SevenEngine
===============

##### Summary

>SevenEngine is a game engine library written entirely in C#. It intends 
>to further abstract graphics libraries such as OpenGL (using OpenTK) and  
>DirectX (using SharpDX) to provide fellow programmers with the tools they 
>need to build the game of their dreams.

>The SevenEngine project is split into two projects: SevenEngine and SevenFramework. 
>SevenEngine is solely for graphics programming. SevenFramework is a general-purpose 
>library I encourage all programmers to give a look. Both projects are written entirely 
>in C#.

>For people new to SevenEngine, there should be a working cross-platform game demo
>in the "Game" project.
