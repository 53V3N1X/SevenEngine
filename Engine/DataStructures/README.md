This data structure files contain runtime values.
All runtimes are in O-Notation. Here is a brief explanation:
- "O(x)": the member has an upper bound of runtime equation "x"
- "Omega(x)": the member has a lower bound of runtime equation "x"
- "Theta(x)": the member has an upper and lower bound of runtime equation "x"
- "EstAvg(x)": the runtime equation "x" to typically expect
Note that if the letter "n" is used, it typically means the current number of items within the set.
